# Changelog

## Unreleased

- No unreleased changes currently tracked.

## 1.1.2 - 2026-04-19

### Added

- added cache-backed Twitch VOD playback so archive assets are verified locally before playout uses them
- added a persistent local relay/uplink publishing mode so program playout failures no longer directly own the external RTMP session

### Changed

- moved scheduled output reconnect ownership to the uplink path, keeping the default Twitch reconnect cadence at 48 hours
- updated production pins and release guidance for the relay/uplink runtime

## 1.0.3 - 2026-04-03

### Fixed

- fixed Twitch channel archive ingestion so channel connectors sync archive VODs instead of failing on offline channel pages
- fixed Twitch archive playback URL normalization for `v<id>` entries emitted by `yt-dlp`
- fixed worker/playout healthchecks by marking ESM worker packages explicitly as modules
- fixed source validation for real YouTube handle/channel URLs and repaired the sources UI for long names and URLs
- fixed playout state recovery so valid assets can automatically clear crash-loop protection
- blocked destructive source deletion while sources are still referenced by pools or schedule blocks
- fixed standby-to-asset switching so the old FFmpeg process is fully stopped before a new one starts
- fixed pool playout selection so the currently running asset stays active instead of rotating every worker cycle

## 1.0.2 - 2026-04-03

### Fixed

- fixed `playout_runtime` persistence SQL so worker and playout no longer crash on PostgreSQL-backed state writes
- stable production env example now points at `v1.0.2`

## 1.0.1 - 2026-03-27

### Added

- added `.env.production.example` with pinned `v1.0.0` image tags for stable deployment
- clarified README and deployment docs to distinguish evaluation envs from production-pinned envs
